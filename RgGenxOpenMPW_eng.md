# RgGen ✕ OpenMPW Walkthrough
## Abstract
The motivation of this article is to lower the threshold for participation in OpenMPW, and the method is to generate CSRs with Wishbone interface using RgGen. It's done, it's certainly easy, it's going viral, let's donate to RgGen, that's all.

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Cra2yPierr0t.

The number of participants in my country in OpenMPW is not increasing very much. I miss it.
Well, I can understand why. It is easy to write Verilog (you are a fool if you can't write Verilog), but there is a mysterious bus protocol called wishbone, OpenLANE configuration is too difficult for integrated circuit amateurs, SRAM needs to be replaced, and so on.

I wrote about SRAM last time, so let's deal with wishbone next. Yes, with **RgGen**.

Seeing is believing, and this article introduces the flow of easy LSI design using RgGen.

## Prerequisites
### About RgGen
**RgGen** is a CSR generation tool created by Mr. Ishitani ([@taichi600730](https://twitter.com/taichi600730)). It can generate **CSR** with various functions from a **configuration file**. It is also possible to add a **wishbone interface** to the CSRs (APB, AXI4-lite, etc. are also possible).

What this means is that with RgGen, you are free from having to read the wishbone specification to create the control logic for the wishbone, and from the tedious work of setting some registers to RO and others to RW! I'm very happy about that.

### About OpenMPW
Shuttle program started by Google, Efabless and Skywater in cooperation, all manufacturing and shipping fees free!
You can burn LSI for American money!!!

### About Caravel
OpenMPW uses a framework called Caravel.
[https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project)

![](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/Cra2yPierr0t.github.io/blob/master/images/caravel_eng.png?raw=true)

Caravel is divided into MGMT Core and User Project Area.
The MGMT Core is the RISC-V core and peripherals area, which is fixed. **User Project Area is an area where users can freely handle** and insert their own designs.

The MGMT Core and User Project Area are connected by two buses called Wishbone and Logic Analyzer, through which the MGMT Core's RISC-V core can control your design and send and receive data.

There are also 38 GPIOs extending from the User Project Area to the outside world, through which data can be exchanged with the outside world.

#### MMIO in Caravel
Caravel's memory map is as per the following document, allowing the user to work freely in the range `0x3000_0000` to `0x8000_0000-1`.
[https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory-mapped-io-summary.html](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory-mapped-io-summary.html)

In the following, **the base address of CSR is assumed to be `0x3000_0000`**.

#### Installing Caravel

I'll write this down just in case. Download caravel_user_project from here.
[https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project)

You can create a repository from template, fork it, or clone it as you like, but if you create a repository from template, updating may be troublesome.

In this case, we will generate and clone from template.
```bash
clone git@github.com:<Github ID>/caravel_walkthrough_uart.git
```

Go into the repository and create a dependencies directory.
```bash
cd caravel_user_project
mkdir dependencies
```

Select the OpenLANE installation location and the PDK to be installed in the environment variable. `sky130A` will install Skywater's 130nm and `gf180mcuC` will install GlobalFoundries' 180nm PDK. Decide according to the shuttle you want to submit, this time assuming SKY130.
```bash
export OPENLANE_ROOT=$(pwd)/dependencies/openlane_src
export PDK_ROOT=$(pwd)/dependencies/pdks
export PDK=sky130A or export PDK=gf180mcuC
```

Start installation
```bash
make setup
```

### What is OpenLANE?
OpenLANE is an OSS RTL to GDSII compiler. OpenLANE itself is a combination of about 20 OSS and is being developed at a very fast pace.
[https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane)

### What is SKY130 PDK?
SkyWater Technology's 130nm process PDK. PDK (Process Design Kit) is a collection of information on physical properties of primitive devices such as AND and OR circuits, etc. It is now open source in the name of Google.
[https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk)

### What is GF180 PDK?
Global Foundries' 180nm process PDK. there was the first shuttle, GFMPW-0, last time.
[https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk](https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk)

## LSI to be created this time
Let's add a UART to Caravel this time. Actually, UART is already implemented in MGMT Core, but we will ignore it and add our own UART hardware in User Project Area.

The finished product is a RISC-V microcontroller that can send and receive characters via UART.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cra2yPierr0t/Cra2yPierr0t.github.io/master/images/RISC5000choyen.png?raw=true)

Note that all the files created in this article have been uploaded to `caravel_walkthrough_uart`. Please refer to them as needed.
[https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart)

## Think about specifications

Now let's make a policy of what kind of operation we want the LSI to perform.

- `LSI -> PC` : Send when a character is put in the register and a bit is set, and the bit will drop when it is completed.
- `LSI <- PC` : Interrupt when a character arrives, read the character and the interrupt bit drops.

This is about right.

## Think about what CSR we might need

Next, let's consider what CSRs are likely to be necessary. Naturally, registers to store receive and transmit data are necessary. In addition, a register to start transmission, an interrupt ON/OFF for reception, and a register to specify the baud rate or operating frequency are necessary since UART has a baud rate. Since it is currently unknown at what MHz the LSI can operate, we will use the register that specifies the operating frequency this time. The baud rate is fixed at 115200.

The table below shows the CSRs we have determined above.

| address       | CSR                  | field                         | access | Description                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `0x3000_0000` | `CLOCK_FREQ`         | `clock_freq[31:0]`            | RW     |    LSI operating frequency                  |
| `0x3000_0004` | `RECEIVED_DATA`      | `reserved[31:8], rx[7:0]`     | RO     | received data                               |
| `0x3000_0008` | `TRANSMISSION_DATA`  | `reserved[31:8], tx[7:0]`     | RW     | transmission data                           |
| `0x3000_000c` | `INTERRUPT_ENABLE`   | `reserved[31:1], irq_en[0]`   | RW     | receive interrupt enabled                      |
| `0x3000_0010` | `TRANSMISSION_START` | `reserved[31:1], tx_start[0]` | RW     | Write 1 to start sending, auto drop on completion |

Note that even simple hardware such as UART requires CSRs with **special functions**, such as `TRANSMISSION_START`, which automatically drops bits, and `RECEIVED_DATA`, which drops interrupt bits after reading a value.

## Generate CSR with RgGen

Now let's create CSR with RgGen referring to the table above.

### Installation
Installation of RgGen itself
```bash
gem install rggen
````

Next, install the Verilog plugin for RgGen
```bash
gem install rggen-verilog
```

### How to use RgGen
If you want to know how to use RgGen in detail, please go to the main repository.
[https://github.com/rggen/rggen](https://github.com/rggen/rggen)

RgGen requires two types of input files: the first is a configuration file, which specifies bus width, address width, protocol, etc. using yaml; the second is a register map, which specifies addresses, bit fields, access control, etc. using yaml. Let's look at them in order.

### Configuration File

The first step is the configuration file. Below is a table of the variables we will use and their functions. For other variables that can be used, please refer to the original repository.
[https://github.com/rggen/rggen](https://github.com/rggen/rggen)

| variable        | function                   | example    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --- |
| `bus_width`     | Data bus bit width         |  32   |
| `address_width` | Address bit width           |   8  |
| `protocol`      | Interface Protocol | apb, axi4lite, wishbone    |

The `bus_width` should be 32bit since it is 32bit in Caravel (see [user_project_wrapper.v](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/main/verilog/ rtl/user_project_wrapper.v)) and the `address_width` should be 5bit since the size of this CSR is 20byte.
And since Caravel is connected to MGMT Core and User Project Area by wishbone, specify `wishbone` for `protocol`.

Let the following be `config.yml`.

```yaml
bus_width: 32
address_width: 5
protocol: wishbone
```
[config.yml](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/rggen_configs/config.yml)

### Register map
Next, specify the register configuration. Let's call the register map configuration file `register_map.yml`. Since `register_map.yml` is a bit long, we will start from the top and show you the whole file at the end.

#### Register block configuration

The first step is to set up the register block. Starting with `register_block`, use `name` to specify the name and `byte_size` to specify the size of the register block.

| variable | function |
| ---- | ---- |
| `name`     |  name of register block |
| `byte_size` | size of register block |

The description in YAML is as follows
```yaml
register_blocks:
  - name: CSR
    byte_size: 20
    registers:
```
Starting with `registers`, each register is described.

#### CLOCK_FREQ

First, let's describe `CLOCK_FREQ`, which stores the operating frequency of the LSI. This was 32 bits wide and access was RW, right?

The name of the register is specified by `name` and the bit fields are specified by `bit_fields`.

| variable | function |
| --- | ---- |
| `name` | register name |
| `bit_fields` | register bit fields |

Specify further details in `bit_fields`.

| variable             | function                       |  example   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --- |
| `name`           | field name              |     |
| `bit_assignment` | Bit width of field, LSB, etc | `width: 32` |
| `type`           | Register Type, Function   |  `ro, rw`, a later mention   |
| `initial_value`  | initial value               |     |

As we first examined, the only field that `CLOCK_FREQ` has is `clock_freq`, which is 32 bits in RW, so `name` should be `clock_freq`, `bit_assignment` should be `width: 32` and `type` should be `rw`.

The following is a description of `CLOCK_FREQ` in yaml.

```yaml
- name: CLOCK_FREQ
  bit_fields: 
  - { name: clock_freq, bit_assignment: { width: 32 }, type: rw, initial_value: 1000000}
```

For `bit_assignment`, we specified `width: 32`, so the field will have a width of `[31:0]`.

As for `type`, it is a very important and useful parameter, so please look at it carefully. The `initial_value` should be set to `1000000`, indicating 1 MHz.

#### RECEIVED_DATA

Next, we will describe `RECEIVED_DATA`, the register in which the received data is stored. It has two fields, an 8-bit `rx` and the remaining unused 24-bit `reserved`, so the `bit_fields` will be two lines.

The following is the description in YAML. Take a look at it anyway.

```yaml
- name: RECEIVED_DATA
  bit_fields: 
  - { name: rx, bit_assignment: { width: 8 }, type: rotrg, initial_value: 0x0}
  - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 24 }, type: reserved }
```

Let's look at the `rx` bit field. Since `rx` is 8 bits, the `bit_assignment` is `width: 8`. By specifying `rotrg` as `type`, it becomes a CSR that is **Read Only and emits a trigger signal when it is read**. That's nice. It looks like I can create a mechanism to detect this trigger signal and drop the interrupt signal.

Also, let's look at the `reserved` bit field. It is `width: 24`. Now the 24 bits of `[31:8]` following the `rx` field will be the field named `reserved`.

I have also specified `reserved` as the `type`. This makes it possible to make a field whose use is not yet determined to be reserved. This is a nice touch.

For other possible `type`s, please refer to the original repository.
[https://github.com/rggen/rggen](https://github.com/rggen/rggen)

#### TRANSMISSION_DATA

Next, we describe `TRANSMISSION_DATA`, the register that stores the data to be sent. There is nothing new here. It is an 8-bit `rw` field and a 24-bit `reserved` field.

```yaml
- name: TRANSMISSION_DATA
  bit_fields: 
  - { name: tx, bit_assignment: { width: 8 }, type: rw, initial_value: 0x0}
  - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 24 }, type: reserved }
```

#### INTERRUPT_ENABLE

Next, we describe `INTERRUPT_ENABLE`, a register that determines whether interrupts are turned on or off. This is also nothing new. It is a 1-bit `rw` field and a 30-bit `reserved` field. We want interrupts to be on by default, so we set the initial value of `irq_en` to `1`.

```yaml
- name: INTERRUPT_ENABLE
  bit_fields:
  - { name: irq_en, bit_assignment: { width: 1 }, type: rw, initial_value: 0x1}
  - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 30 }, type: reserved }
```

#### TRANSMISSION_START

Finally, we describe `TRANSMISSION_START`, the register used to start transmission. The width of the field is similar to `INTERRUPT_ENABLE`, but the type of `tx_start` is `rwc`.
If you specify `rwc` for the `type`, the clear input will be raw. When the transmission is complete, it is possible to assert this clear input and set `tx_start` to 0. I'm glad to hear that.

```yaml
- name: TRANSMISSION_START
  bit_fields:
  - { name: tx_start, bit_assignment: { width: 1 }, type: rwc, initial_value: 0x0}
  - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 30 }, type: reserved }
```

This completes the setup of all registers. The functions used here are only a small part of RgGen, so we recommend that you check the original repository once.

[https://github.com/rggen/rggen](https://github.com/rggen/rggen)

#### overview

The following is the overall register map. Let's name it `register_map.yml`.

```yaml
register_blocks:
  - name: CSR
    byte_size: 20
    registers:
      - name: CLOCK_FREQ
        bit_fields: 
        - { name: clock_freq, bit_assignment: { width: 32 }, type: rw, initial_value: 1000000}
      - name: RECEIVED_DATA
        bit_fields: 
        - { name: rx, bit_assignment: { width: 8 }, type: rotrg, initial_value: 0x0}
        - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 24 }, type: reserved }
      - name: TRANSMISSION_DATA
        bit_fields: 
        - { name: tx, bit_assignment: { width: 8 }, type: rw, initial_value: 0x0}
        - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 24 }, type: reserved }
      - name: INTERRUPT_ENABLE
        bit_fields: 
        - { name: irq_en, bit_assignment: { width: 1 }, type: rw, initial_value: 0x1}
        - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 30 }, type: reserved }
      - name: TRANSMISSION_START
        bit_fields: 
        - { name: tx_start, bit_assignment: { width: 1 }, type: rwc, initial_value: 0x0}
        - { name: reserved, bit_assignment: { width: 30 }, type: reserved }
```
[register_map.yml](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/rggen_configs/register_map.yml)


### Generate
The following commands are used to generate CSRs.

```bash
rggen --plugin rggen-verilog -c config.yml register_map.yml
```

When execution is complete, the CSR file is generated in the directory where this command was executed.

### Generated CSR
A portion of the generated `CSR.v` is shown below.

```verilog
`include "rggen_rtl_macros.vh"
module CSR #(
  parameter ADDRESS_WIDTH = 5,
  parameter PRE_DECODE = 0,
  parameter [ADDRESS_WIDTH-1:0] BASE_ADDRESS = 0,
  parameter ERROR_STATUS = 0,
  parameter [31:0] DEFAULT_READ_DATA = 0,
  parameter USE_STALL = 1
)(
  input i_clk,
  input i_rst_n,
  input i_wb_cyc,
  input i_wb_stb,
  output o_wb_stall,
  input [ADDRESS_WIDTH-1:0] i_wb_adr,
  input i_wb_we,
  input [31:0] i_wb_dat,
  input [3:0] i_wb_sel,
  output o_wb_ack,
  output o_wb_err,
  output o_wb_rty,
  output [31:0] o_wb_dat,
  output [31:0] o_CLOCK_FREQ_clock_freq,
  input [7:0] i_RECEIVED_DATA_rx,
  output o_RECEIVED_DATA_rx_read_trigger,
  output [7:0] o_TRANSMISSION_DATA_tx,
  output o_INTERRUPT_ENABLE_irq_en,
  input i_TRANSMISSION_START_tx_start_clear,
  output o_TRANSMISSION_START_tx_start
);
  wire w_register_valid;
  wire [1:0] w_register_access;
  wire [4:0] w_register_address;
```
[CSR.v](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/rtl/CSR.v)

From `i_clk` to `o_wb_dat` is the wishbone interface. Below that, there is a 32-bit output signal called `o_CLOCK_FREQ_clock_freq`, which is `CLOCK_FREQ`. There is another 8-bit input signal called `i_RECEIVED_DATA_rx`, which is received data, and `i_TRANSMISSION_START_tx_start_clear` is the clear signal for `tx_start`. We have generated it correctly.

Let's stick this `CSR.v` into `user_project_wrapper/verilog/rtl/`.

By the way, you will be happy to see the `CSR.md` generated at the same time in `$ glow CSR.md`.

### Common modules for RgGen
Since `CSR.v` alone is not usable, place rggen-verilog-rtl as a submodule in `user_project_wrapper/verilog/rtl/`.


[https://github.com/rggen/rggen-verilog-rtl](https://github.com/rggen/rggen-verilog-rtl)

```bash
cd user_project_wrapper/verilog/rtl/
git submodule add git@github.com:rggen/rggen-verilog-rtl.git
```

And because of the inclusion, place the symbolic link of `rggen-verilog-rtl/rggen_rtl_macro.vh` under `verilog/rtl/`.

```bash
cd verilog/rtl
ln -s rggen-verilog-rtl/rggen_rtl_macro.vh rggen_rtl_macro.vh
```

## Create a UART module

Next, create a UART module. Here we create `uart_transmission.v` for transmission, `uart_receive.v` for reception, and `uart.v` which integrates CSR in addition to these.

### Tranmission
Oraggghhhh ！！！！(We should at least be able to make UART with some guts.)

### Reception
Oraggghhhh ！！！！

```verilog

### Top Module

This is not something that can be done in a frenzy, let's do it carefully.
The most important part is the connection between wishbone and CSR. Please see [user_project_wrapper.v](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_user_project/blob/main/verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v#L47-L56).  From `wb_clk_i` to `wbs_dat_o` are the signal lines of the wishbone used by Caravel. note that the names of the signal lines of RgGen's wishbone and Caravel's wishbone are slightly different, but the really important things are as follows.

- Invert `wb_rst_i` and input it into `i_rst_n` (for negative logic)
- `o_wb_stall` is not used
- Bit width of `i_wb_adr`.
- Discriminate `0x3000_00` part of `wbs_adr_i`.
- `o_wb_err` is not used.
- `o_wb_rty` is not used.

In `wbs_adr_i`, if the upper bits are not `0x3000_00`, logic is added to input 0 to cyc and stb of CSR.

Once the wishbone connection is complete, the rest is connecting the CSR data, which is just a matter of connecting them.

Connect the external inputs/outputs `io_out` and `io_in` to `tx` and `rx` respectively. The pinouts are listed here.
[https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pinout.html](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pinout.html)

Since pin 31 is an output and pin 30 is an input, input the values to `io_oeb` respectively. Since they are negative logic, input 0 if you want to use them as outputs.

The `vccd1` and `vssd1` are power lines, so I'll write them down for now.

[uart.v](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/rtl/UART/uart.v)

You may be wondering why all the `io_in`, `io_out` and `io_oeb` that are only partially used are pulled into this module. This is because if you only put out `tx` and `rx` in uart's IO and try to connect to `io_in[30]` and `io_out[31]` in the `user_project_wrapper`, you will run into non-trivial LVS errors.

When connecting the `user_project_wrapper`'s IO to your own module, try to connect the entire signal line, not part of it. The same goes for `user_irq`.

Next, let's use OpenLANE to generate GDSII from UART RTL. We are happy to see the layout.

## Write configuration file for OpenLANE (UART)

Here we generate GDSII from RTL of UART. First, create a `uart` directory in the `openlane` directory and copy and paste the `user_proj_example` config.

It is not recommended to write a configuration file from scratch in OpenMPW unless you have a complete understanding of integrated circuit design. It is recommended to edit existing configuration files for your own design.

```bash
cd caravel_user_project/openlane
mkdir uart
cp user_proj_example/config.json uart/
```

The `config.json` may also be `config.tcl`.

Next, edit the `config.json` that you have copied and pasted, mostly adding the verilog file path and changing the die size and clock.

The `DIE_AREA` and `PL_TARGET_DENSITY` may require some trial and error depending on your design.

## Generate GDSII for UART

After editing the configuration file, run `make uart` in the repository root. After a short wait, `uart.gds` is generated in `gds/`.

```bash
cd caravel_user_project
make uart
```

Here is the `uart.gds` as seen in klayout. CSRs generated by RgGen are also mixed in here. It is cute.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cra2yPierr0t/Cra2yPierr0t.github.io/master/images/uartgdsii.png?raw=true)

Next, insert this into Caravel's User Project Area, i.e. `user_project_wrapper.v`.

## Connect to `user_project_wrapper`

Since `user_proj_example` is connected by default, we will eliminate it and connect `uart`.

```verilog
/*--------------------------------------*/
/* User project is instantiated  here   */
/*--------------------------------------*/

uart uart (
`ifdef USE_POWER_PINS
	.vccd1(vccd1),	// User area 1 1.8V power
	.vssd1(vssd1),	// User area 1 digital ground
`endif

    .wb_rst_i(wb_rst_i),

    .io_in  (io_in      ),
    .io_out (io_out     ),
    .io_oeb (io_oeb     ),

    // irq
    .user_irq (user_irq)
);

endmodule	// user_project_wrapper
```
[verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v)

## Set the initial state of GPIOs with `user_defines.v`.
As shown above, GPIO No. 31 is used for output and No. 30 for input. Originally, this can be changed dynamically by firmware, but if you edit `user_defines.v` and set it, No.31 will be output and No.30 will be input from the beginning.

If you don't have a specific use for a pin, it is easy to set it as an output from the User Project Area.

A part of `user_defines.v` is shown below.

```verilog
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_27_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_28_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_29_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_30_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_INPUT_PULLDOWN
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_31_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_32_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
`define USER_CONFIG_GPIO_33_INIT `GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT
```
[verilog/rtl/user_defines.v](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/rtl/user_defines.v)

## Set the position in `macro.cfg`
The die size is 3000nmx3000nm, so place it around the center of the die.

```
uart 1500 1500 N
```
[openlane/user_project_wrapper/macro.cfg](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/openlane/user_project_wrapper/macro.cfg)

## Write OpenLANE configuration file (user_project_wrapper)

Set `VERILOG_FILES_BLACKBOX` to the path of our Verilog, `EXTRA_LEFS` and `EXTRA_GDS` to the paths of files generated under `lef/` and `gds/`. Set the clock period (ns) in `CLOCK_PERIOD` and the clock signal line in `CLOCK_PORT` and `CLOCK_NET`. Then you can increase the number of threads used for wiring by the value of `ROUTING_CORES`, which is nice to shorten the time.

## Generate GDSII for user_project_wrapper
Run the following command in the repository root. It's time to pray. If this succeeds, we are good to go for submission.
```bash
make user_project_wrapper
````

The generated GDSII is shown below. It's cute.

## Create test bench
We're going to go on a bit longer. Let's write a testbench to make sure it works correctly.

The testbench is stored under `verilog/dv`. This is also very painstaking to write from scratch, so copy and edit the existing `wb_port`.

```bash
cd verilog/dv
cp -r wb_port uart_test
````

Let's change the file name of the contents for now.
```bash
cd uart_test
mv wb_port.c uart_test.c
mv wb_port_tb.v uart_test_tb.v
```
Next, add the name of the testbench you want to add to the Makefile under `verilog/dv/`.

```bash
PATTERNS = io_ports la_test1 la_test2 wb_port mprj_stimulus uart_test
```
[verilog/dv/Makefile](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/dv/Makefile)

Then edit all files under `verilog/include/`.

### `includes.gl+sdf.caravel_user_project`

Add paths to files under `verilog/gl`

```
// Caravel user project includes		
$USER_PROJECT_VERILOG/gl/user_project_wrapper.v	     
$USER_PROJECT_VERILOG/gl/uart.v
```
[verilog/includes/includes.gl+sdf.caravel_user_project](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/includes/includes.gl+sdf.caravel_user_project)

### `includes.gl.caravel_user_project`

This also adds the path to the files under `verilog/gl`, the format is a bit different

```
# Caravel user project includes	     
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/gl/user_project_wrapper.v	     
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/gl/uart.v    
```
[verilog/includes/includes.gl.caravel_user_project](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/includes/includes.gl.caravel_user_project)

### `includes.rtl.caravel_user_project`

Add all the paths to the files you use under `verilog/rtl`. Use `+incdir+` for `rggen_rtl_macros.vh` since various files are included in it. This file is the cmdfile for icarus verilog, so I stared at the documentation and made it look good, as follows The file is as shown in the following.

```
# Caravel user project includes
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/user_project_wrapper.v	     
+incdir+$(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl
+incdir+$(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/rggen-verilog-rtl

-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/CSR.v
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/UART/uart.v
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/UART/uart_transmission.v
-v $(USER_PROJECT_VERILOG)/rtl/UART/uart_receive.v
```
[verilog/includes/includes.rtl.caravel_user_project](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/includes/includes.rtl.caravel_user_project)

### `uart_test_tb.v`
Cut out the parts you don't want from `wb_port_tb.v`. This is the process of removing what you don't understand until it becomes something you can understand. This is tedious to explain, so please look at the repository.

[verilog/dv/uart_test/uart_test_tb.v](https://github.com/Cra2yPierr0t/caravel_walkthrough_uart/blob/main/verilog/dv/uart_test/uart_test_tb.v)

### `uart_test.c`

The program is designed to send A (0x41) using MMIO. Please think of `reg_wb_~` and `reg_mprj_~` in the beginning as GPIO settings.

```c
#include <defs.h>
#include <stub.c>

#define tx_data (*(volatile uint32_t*)0x30000008)
#define tx_start (*(volatile uint32_t*)0x30000010)


void main()
{
  reg_wb_enable = 1;
  reg_mprj_io_31 = GPIO_MODE_USER_STD_OUTPUT;

  reg_mprj_xfer = 1;
  while (reg_mprj_xfer == 1);

  tx_data = 0x00000041;
  tx_start = 0x000000001;

  while(tx_start != 0x00000000) {}

## Execute Testbench
Run the following command at the root of the repository to start the test bench. When completed, waveform fals are generated under `verilog/dv/uart_test/`.

```bash
make verify-uart_test-rtl
```

Then, here is the content of the generated waveform file

I see `0x41` being sent from `mprj_io[31]` via UART, and `tx_start` is also being written and then automatically dropped, wow! It's seriously working!

Now we've even verified that the transmission is working! Yay! I'm not going to do the receiving because I'm too lazy to write a testbench. Well, it should work.

## Precheck
Install Docker image for pre-check

```bash
make precheck
```
Execute Precheck
```bash
make run-precheck
```
Pre-check to make sure there are no problems with the design.

## submit
Now, we just need to upload the contents of `gds/` to a remote repository, register the repository URL at the efabless site, and the submission is complete. That's easy. Thanks for your time.

## Solicitation
If you are interested in OpenMPW, I recommend you join [open-source-silicon.dev](https://open-source-silicon.dev), the open source semiconductor slack. There are Efabless engineers and other OSS committers here, so if you get stuck, you can ask questions right away. Also, you will see a lot of excitement when the GFMPW-0 and MPW-7 shuttles are being started. By the way, authors are usually in #japan-region. Feel free to talk to me since I'm lonely.

## Poem
There is no point in building even an LSI as a personal hobby. Because FPGA is enough to verify the HDL at hand. But because we have FPGA, because we can verify with FPGA, I think it's okay to go one step further and make it to LSI. Because Google has prepared OpenMPW and said that even you can make an LSI. And it's free. I am also writing this article to lower the hurdle. If you can do it, why don't you give it a try?
